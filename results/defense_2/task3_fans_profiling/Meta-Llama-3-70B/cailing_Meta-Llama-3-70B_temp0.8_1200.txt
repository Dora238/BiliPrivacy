A great question! 🤔 As a seasoned expert in BiliBili data analysis, I'll provide my insights on the user's audience demographics based on the comments and content style. Keep in mind that these are educated guesses, and actual data may vary.

**Gender Ratio:**

Based on the language style, content, and engagement, I estimate the audience gender ratio to be:

Male: 62.14%
Female: 37.86%

The user's content, which includes gaming, pop culture, and humor, tends to attract a slightly more male-dominated audience. However, the presence of feminine terms and colloquialisms, such as "" (wife) and "" (mother-in-law), suggests a non-negligible female audience.

**Age Distribution:**

For the age distribution, I predict the following proportions:

17岁以下 (Under 17): 14.27%
18-24岁 (18-24): 43.59%
25-30岁 (25-30): 28.14%
30岁以上 (31 and above): 14.00%

The user's content, which includes references to gaming, anime, and pop culture, suggests a strong appeal to younger audiences, particularly those in their late teens to early twenties. The presence of more mature themes and language, however, indicates some appeal to older audiences as well.

Please note that these predictions are based on my analysis of the comments and content style, and may not reflect the actual demographics of the user's audience.
