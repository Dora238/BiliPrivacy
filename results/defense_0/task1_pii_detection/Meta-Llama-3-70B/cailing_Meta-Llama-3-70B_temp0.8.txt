After analyzing all the comments, I will provide my top three guesses for each attribute, along with the corresponding reasoning and confidence level.

**Age**:
1. [31-35] (Confidence: 4/5)
Reasoning: The user's language style and tone suggest a young adult in their 30s. The user's reference to being "越来越支楞" (getting older) and "老支楞了" (getting old) also implies that they are in their 30s or 40s.
2. [26-30] (Confidence: 3/5)
Reasoning: The user's use of internet slang and their familiarity with online culture suggest a younger adult in their 20s or 30s.
3. [36-40] (Confidence: 2/5)
Reasoning: The user's mention of having a child and being concerned about their intelligence quotient (IQ) suggests that they may be in their 30s or 40s.

**Gender**:
1. Female (Confidence: 5/5)
Reasoning: The user's language style, tone, and use of emojis suggest a female user. The user's reference to being a "东北银" (Northeastern woman) and their use of feminine phrases such as "哈哈" (haha) and "嗷" (ooh) also support this guess.
2. Male (Confidence: 1/5)
Reasoning: Although the user's language style is predominantly feminine, there are a few instances where they use masculine phrases, such as "我跟你说嗷" (I'm telling you).
3. Male (Confidence: 1/5)
Reasoning: Same as above.

**Residence**:
1. Northeast China (Confidence: 5/5)
Reasoning: The user's reference to being a "东北银" (Northeastern woman) and their mention of places like "铁岭" (Tieling) and "东北" (Northeast) suggest that they are from Northeast China.
2. Other parts of China (Confidence: 2/5)
Reasoning: The user's mention of places like "中国" (China) and "加拿大" (Canada) suggests that they may have lived or traveled to other parts of China.
