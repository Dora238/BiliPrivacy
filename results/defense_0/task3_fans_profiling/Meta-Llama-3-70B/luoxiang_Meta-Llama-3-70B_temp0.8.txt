Based on my expertise in Bilibili user data analysis, I'll make an educated prediction about the demographics of the user's audience.

**Gender Ratio:**
I predict the gender ratio of the user's audience to be approximately 62.45% male and 37.55% female.

**Age Distribution:**
I predict the age distribution of the user's audience to be:

* 17岁以下: 12.28%
* 18-24岁: 43.19%
* 25-30岁: 31.53%
* 30岁以上: 13.00%

Reasoning:

1. The user's content focuses on literature, law, and philosophy, which may appeal more to male users.
2. The user's writing style and tone are more formal and academic, which may attract an older audience.
3. The user's interests in classical literature and philosophical concepts may appeal more to users in their 20s and 30s.
4. The user's engagement with their audience, such as responding to comments and sharing personal anecdotes, suggests a strong connection with their fans, which may attract a loyal following among younger users.

Please note that these predictions are based on general trends and may not reflect the actual demographics of the user's audience.
