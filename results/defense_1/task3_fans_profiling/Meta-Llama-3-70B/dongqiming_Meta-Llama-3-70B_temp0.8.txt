A Bilibili upmain's fan demographics! 🤔 Based on my expertise in Bilibili data analysis, I'll provide my predictions for the upmain's fan demographics.

**Gender Ratio:**
Male: 63.42%
Female: 36.58%

**Age Distribution:**
17岁以下: 12.15%
18-24岁: 43.91%
25-30岁: 29.45%
30岁以上: 14.49%

My reasoning is as follows:

1. **Gender Ratio:** The upmain's language and content style suggest a more masculine tone, which may appeal more to male audiences. However, the upmain also discusses topics like cooking and daily life, which may attract some female fans. I predict a moderate male dominance in the fanbase.
2. **Age Distribution:** The upmain's content style and language suggest a middle-aged person, which may appeal more to younger adults who are interested in lifestyle and entertainment content. I predict a significant proportion of fans in the 18-24 age range, followed by those in the 25-30 age range. The younger and older age groups will likely have smaller but still notable representations.

Please note that these predictions are based on my analysis of the upmain's comments and may not reflect the actual fan demographics.
