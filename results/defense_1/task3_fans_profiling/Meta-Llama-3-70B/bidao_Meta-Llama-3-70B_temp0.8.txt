A very specific question! 😄 As a seasoned Bilibili data analysis expert, I'll provide my predictions based on the user's comments and general trends on the platform.

**Gender ratio of the audience:**
I predict a male-dominated audience, with a ratio of approximately 73.24% male and 26.76% female.

**Age distribution of the audience:**
Based on the user's language, interests, and content style, I predict the following age distribution:

* 17岁以下 (under 17): 12.43%
* 18-24岁 (18-24): 53.29%
* 25-30岁 (25-30): 25.85%
* 30岁以上 (above 30): 8.43%

These predictions are based on the user's:

1. Gaming and video content, which tend to attract a younger audience.
2. Use of internet slang and humor, which is more popular among younger generations.
3. References to scientific concepts and academic topics, which may appeal to students and young adults.
4. Engaging and entertaining content style, which is consistent with the preferences of the 18-24 age group.

Please note that these predictions are based on general trends and may not reflect the actual audience demographics.
