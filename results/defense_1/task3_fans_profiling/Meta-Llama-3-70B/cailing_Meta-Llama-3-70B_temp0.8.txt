Based on the provided comments and Danmu, I will analyze and infer the user's audience demographics on Bilibili. As a seasoned data analysis expert, I will provide my predictions on the gender ratio and age distribution of the user's fans.

**Gender Ratio**:
Male: 43.12%
Female: 56.88%

**Age Distribution**:
17 or younger: 15.62%
18-24: 41.27%
25-30: 29.51%
31 or older: 13.60%

My reasoning is based on the following observations:

1. Language style and tone: The user's comments and Danmu exhibit a playful, casual, and humorous tone, which is more appealing to a younger adult audience.
2. Content topics: The user discusses topics such as family, relationships, and daily life, which are more relevant to young adults and females.
3. Interactions with fans: The user frequently interacts with fans, responding to comments and engaging in conversations, which suggests a strong connection with a younger audience.
4. Bilibili platform trends: Bilibili's user base skews towards a younger demographic, with a majority of users under the age of 30.

Please note that these predictions are based on my analysis of the provided comments and Danmu, and may not reflect the actual demographics of the user's audience.
