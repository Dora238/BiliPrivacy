Based on my expertise in Bilibili user data and general trends, I can make an educated guess about the demographics of this UP主's audience.

**Gender Ratio**

Based on the UP主's content and writing style, I estimate that the gender ratio of their audience is:

Male: 63.42%
Female: 36.58%

The UP主's focus on literature, law, and philosophy, as well as their analytical and introspective writing style, may appeal more to male audiences. However, the UP主's interest in storytelling and their effort to engage with their audience may also attract a significant number of female viewers.

**Age Distribution**

Based on the UP主's content and the language used, I estimate that the age distribution of their audience is:

17岁以下: 10.25%
18-24岁: 34.15%
25-30岁: 26.50%
30岁以上: 29.10%

The UP主's focus on complex topics and their analytical writing style may appeal more to older audiences who have a higher level of education and intellectual curiosity. However, the UP主's use of popular culture references and their effort to engage with their audience may also attract a significant number of younger viewers.

Please note that these estimates are based on my expertise and may not reflect the actual demographics of the UP主's audience.
